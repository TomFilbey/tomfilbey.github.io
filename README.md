Welcome to my personal website! I'm Tom, and I've created this space to track and share my journey as a software developer. This site, starting as a simple README or markdown file, serves as a reminder to myself that sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution.

#### Why This Website?
I believe in the power of reflection and documentation in a developer's career. This website serves as a platform where I can track my progress, share insights, and connect with the community.

#### My Development Approach
- **Test Driven Development (TDD):** Ensuring reliability and robustness of code from the start.
- **Trunk Based Development (TBD):** Focusing on single-source-of-truth for codebase to streamline collaboration.
- **Daily Deploys:** Embracing a culture of continuous integration and regular updates.
- **New Relic Monitoring:** Utilizing real-time insights to optimize application performance and reliability.
